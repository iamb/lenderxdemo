In the diagrams, the blue arrows represent Outbound Transports triggered by specific events in LenderX, such as order assignment, which will send a JSON message to a specified endpoint informing the Vendor that an event has occurred in LenderX. The orange arrows represent LenderX endpoints that the Vendor can send data back to which will also trigger events in LenderX. \n\n## Order Assignment\n\n![Order Assignment Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/order_assignment_workflow.png)\n\n1.  The Lender assigns an appraisal order to the Vendor. The Vendor can be notified of the order assignment via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **An appraisal order has been assigned to an appraiser** will trigger when the Lender assigns the appraisal order to the Vendor. \n2.  The Vendor integration can optionally perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}** using the order_id found in the **An appraisal order has been assigned to an appraiser** event to return details of the order data. \n3.  The Vendor can optionally perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/documents** to retrieve any documents, such as the purchase contract, the Lender has attached to the order. \n4.  The Vendor can perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/document\/{document_id}** using the document_id found to download the documents attached to the order. \n5.  The Vendor can optionally perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/comments** to view any comments the Lender had placed on the appraisal order. \n6.  The Vendor can optionally perform a POST to **\/comment** to send a comment, such as negotiating fees, on the order to the Lender prior to order acceptance.  \n7.  The Vendor must either accept or decline the appraisal order:\n    * The Vendor can accept the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/accept**. \n    * The Vendor can decline the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/decline**. \n\n## Order Assignment for Appraisal Router Companies\n\n![Comment Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/assignment_routing_workflow.png)\n\n1.  The Lender assigns an appraisal order to the Vendor. The Vendor can be notified of the order assignment through Outbound Transports. The Outbound Transport **An appraisal order has been assigned to an appraiser** will trigger when the Lender assigns the appraisal order to the Vendor. \n2.  The Appraisal Router user for the Vendor checks for Appraisers at their company who are eligible to be assigned the order by performing a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/available_appraisers**. This will return user_ids for Appraisers who are eligible to be assigned the order. \n3.  The Appraisal Router user assigns the order to one of their eligible Appraisers by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/assign\/{user_id}**.\n4.  The Vendor can accept the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/accept**. \n\n## Conditional Acceptance\n\n![Conditional Acceptance Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/conditional_acceptance_workflow.png)\n\n1.  The Lender assigns an appraisal order to the Vendor. The Vendor can be notified of the order assignment via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **Event.Appraisal.Order.Assigned** will trigger when the Lender assigns the appraisal order to the Vendor.\n2.  The Vendor can accept, decline, or conditionally accept the appraisal order:\n    * The Vendor can accept the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/accept**.\n    * The Vendor can decline the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/decline**.\n    * The Vendor can conditionally accept the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/acceptance_terms**.\n      * The Vendor can change the **expected_delivery_date**, the **fees** on an order, or both.\n3.  The Lender can accept the Vendor’s conditions, reject the Vendor’s conditions, or renegotiate the Vendor’s conditions:\n    * Accept: The Vendor can be notified when the Lender accepts their conditions via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **Event.Appraisal.Order.Accepted** will trigger when the Lender accepts the Vendor’s conditions, and the order will transition into In Progress status.\n    * Reject: The Vendor can be notified when the Lender rejects their conditions via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **Event.Appraisal.Order.Cancelled** will trigger when the Lender rejects the Vendor’s conditions, and the order will be cancelled for the Vendor.\n    * Renegotiate: The Vendor can be notified when the Lender renegotiates the conditions via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **Event.Appraisal.Order.Renegotiated** will trigger when the Lender renegotiates the conditions, and the order will remain in Accepted with Conditions status.\n4.  The Vendor can accept the Lender’s conditions, decline the Lender’s conditions, or renegotiate the Lender’s conditions:\n    * Accept: The Vendor can accept the Lender’s conditions by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/acceptance_terms\/{negotiation_id}\/accept**. The order will transition into In Progress status.\n    * Decline: The Vendor can reject the Lender’s conditions by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/acceptance_terms\/{negotiation_id}\/decline**. The order will transition into Cancelled status.\n    * Renegotiate: The Vendor can renegotiate the Lender’s conditions by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/acceptance_terms**. The Vendor must include the negotiation_id from the Lender’s conditions (found in the event **Event.Appraisal.Order.Renegotiated** or by performing a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/acceptance_terms**) as the **parent_negotiation_id**. The order will remain in Accepted with Conditions status.\n5.  The Lender can accept, reject, or renegotiate the Vendor’s conditions. This renegotiation process continues until the Vendor or the Lender accepts the conditions or rejects the conditions.\n\n\n## Comments\n\n![Comment Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/comment_workflow.png)\n\n1.  Lenders can, at any time, place a comment on the appraisal order. The Vendor can be notified of a comment via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **A comment has been added to an order** will trigger when the Lender places a comment on an order. \n2.  The Vendor can optionally perform a GET to **\/comment\/{comment_id}** using the comment_id found in the **A comment has been added to an order** event to return the comment details. \n3.  The Vendor can, at any time while the order is assigned, place a comment on the appraisal order by performing a POST to **\/comment**. \n\n*Note: The Vendor can only send comments on appraisal orders while they are assigned to the Vendor. If an order is reassigned, the Vendor cannot comment.*\n\n## Set Appraisal Dates\n\n![Set Dates Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/set_date_workflow.png)\n\n### To set or update appraisal order dates:\n\n1.  The Vendor can perform a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/set_dates** to inform the Lender of the estimated inspection date, expected delivery date and scheduled inspection date. \n\n## Deliver Appraisal Documents\n\n![Deliver Documents Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/deliver_doc_workflow.png)\n\n### There are two ways to deliver new appraisal documents\n\n1.  Delivery using base64 encoded documents:\n    * The Vendor can deliver base64 encoded appraisal documents (appraisal pdf, appraisal MISMO, and invoice) by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/appraisal**. \n2.  Delivery using document_id:\n    * The Vendor uploads appraisal documents (appraisal pdf, appraisal MISMO, and invoice) by performing a POST to the **\/document** endpoint. This will return a document_id for each uploaded document. The Vendor then sets those documents as appraisal documents by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/appraisal** using the document_id for each specified document.\n\n*Note: Delivering revised appraisal documents follows the same steps as delivering new appraisal documents, however the Vendor must reference the **original_document_id** for the report that is being updated.* \n\n## Deliver Invoices\n\n![Deliver Invoices Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/invoice_workflow.png)\n\n### To send a new or revised invoice:\n\n1.   The Vendor can upload a new or revised base64 encoded invoice by performing a POST to the **\/document** endpoint. This will return a document_id for each uploaded document. The Vendor then delivers the invoice by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/invoice** using the document_id for each uploaded invoice.  \n\n## Deliver UCDP SSR Documents\n\n![Deliver UCDP SSRs Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/ucdp_workflow.png)\n\n### To deliver successful UCDP SSR documents:\n\n1.  The Vendor can upload successful UCDP SSR base64 encoded documents by performing a POST to the **\/document** endpoint. This will return a document_id for each uploaded document. The Vendor then delivers the successful UCDP SSR documents by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/ucdp_ssr** using the document_id for each uploaded UCDP SSR document. \n\n*Only deliver UCDP SSR documents that have a Document File Status of “Successful”.*\n\n## Deliver EAD SSR Documents\n\n![Deliver EAD SSRs Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/ead_workflow.png)\n\n### To deliver successful EAD SSR documents:\n\n1.  The Vendor can upload successful EAD SSR base64 encoded documents by performing a POST to the **\/document** endpoint. This will return a document_id for each uploaded document. The Vendor then delivers the successful EAD SSR documents by performing a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/ead_ssr** using the document_id for each uploaded EAD SSR document.  \n\n*Only deliver EAD SSR documents that have a Document File Status of “Successful”.*\n\n## Address Stipulations\n\n![Address Stipulations Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/stip_workflow.png)\n\n Any corrections requested by the Lender are sent as stipulations that must be addressed by the Vendor. Stipulations may also include a Reconsideration of Value document to download. A Reconsideration of Value (ROV) is an optional PDF document the Lender can send to request the Vendor reconsider the valuation on the appraisal. \n\n### To address stipulations:\n\n 1. The Lender sends stipulations to the Vendor. The Vendor can be notified when stipulations are sent via their configured Outbound Transport. The event **A stipulation has been requested** will trigger when the Lender sends stipulations to the Vendor. \n2.  The Vendor can optionally perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/stipulations** to view the stipulations. \n    * If a Reconsideration of Value is requested, the attached ROV document will be included in the attached_document_id field. \n    * To obtain the ROV document, perform a GET to **\/order\/{order_id}\/document\/{document_id}** using the attached_document_id for the document. \n3.  The Vendor must respond to the stipulations:\n    * If rejecting all stipulations, the Vendor can perform a POST to **\/order\/{order_id}\/reject_stipulations**. \n    * If correcting the stipulations, the Vendor can deliver the revised appraisal document either through using base64 encoded documents or using the document_id. The Vendor must reference the original_document_id for the original appraisal document. Follow the steps under the **Deliver Appraisal Document** section for instructions on delivering an appraisal document. Uploading a revised document resolves all outstanding stipulations for the original document. \n\n## Configure Outbound Transport\n\n![Configure Transports Workflow](\/appraisal\/doc\/configure_transports_workflow.png)\n\nLenderX uses a configured Outbound Transport to send messages, or “events”, to an external system whenever certain actions are sent to the Vendor through LenderX. LenderX Implementation representatives can set up an Outbound Transport for the Vendor or the Vendor can use the following endpoints to configure a transport. \n\n1.  The Vendor can view their configured Outbound Transport by performing a GET to **\/event**. \n2.  The Vendor can configure the setup of an existing Outbound Transport by performing a POST to **\/event**. \n3.  The Vendor can remove a configured Outbound Transport by performing a DELETE to **\/event\/{event_id}**. \n\n# Authentication\n\nAuthentication is modeled around the OAuth2 spec using the [client credentials flow](https:\/\/tools.ietf.org\/html\/rfc6749#section-4.4).\n\n### Steps\n\n1) After setting up your active connections you will receive API credentials in the form of a client key and secret.\n2) These credentials are posted to the authentication server's \/access_token endpoint requesting a client_credentials grant.\n3) The previous response returns a body payload of json. The 'access_token' field is your oauth token and their are other fields that tell you some meta data about the token itself (such as expiration).\n4) The token is then sent in subsequent requests to the LenderX Vendor API as an authorization header bearer token (Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN)\n5) The token will expire after a short time. When this happens you repeat step #2\n\n### Step 2 Example Request\n###### (to get token from auth server)\n\n##### Template\n\n```\n# Template\ncurl -k -X POST                                                \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n    --header 'Accept: application\/json'                        \\\n    -u $API_KEY:$API_SECRET                                    \\\n    -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'                         \\\n    $AUTH_SERVER_HOST\/oauth\/access_token\n\n\n# Example\ncurl -k -X POST                                                \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n    --header 'Accept: application\/json'                        \\\n    -u 1SMxzhcqFO8qGsVInsfLKw:zN58-NOsbdovgoBBFSS8Og           \\\n    -d 'grant_type=client_credentials'                         \\\n    https:\/\/idp.sandbox1.lenderx-labs.com\/oauth\/access_token\n```\n\n### Step 3 Example Response\n###### (the oauth bearer token to use with the LenderX Vendor API)\n\n```json\n{\n    \"access_token\": \"eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOm51bGwsImNsaWVudCI6IjFTTXh6aGNxRk84cUdzVkluc2ZMS3ciLCJleHAiOjE0OTY0MzM0NjUsImlhdCI6MTQ5NjM0NzA1NSwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3Rlc3QzLmxlbmRlcnguYXNzdXJhbnQuY29tIiwianRpIjoibWNmcHdPUGpMV084VjExZXBCb1ByNndyT0ZnTVAzVnYiLCJzY29wZXMiOltdLCJzdWIiOjExNTU4MywidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOm51bGx9.k5Kr-jZPQbFD931DOZmDOM7NyiLqAkCfrW5mMh7Avdk\",\n    \"expires_in\": 86400,\n    \"token_type\": \"Bearer\"\n}\n```\n\n### Step 4 Example Request\n###### (accessing the LenderX Vendor API with our oauth bearer token)\n```\n# Template\ncurl -k -X GET                                                 \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n    --header 'Accept: application\/json'                        \\\n    --header 'Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN'                    \\\n    $LX_AMC_API_HOST\/me\n\n# Example\n\nexport TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJhdWQiOm51bGwsImNsaWVudCI6IjFTTXh6aGNxRk84cUdzVkluc2ZMS3ciLCJleHAiOjE0OTY0MzI1MTgsImlhdCI6MTQ5NjM0NjExOCwiaXNzIjoiaHR0cHM6XC9cL3Rlc3QzLmxlbmRlcnguYXNzdXJhbnQuY29tIiwianRpIjoiY2xwdkFwNm00THVIRXgzOVp0Ykw4OTFxNGhIOWJ1YkoiLCJzY29wZXMiOlsiaWRwOmludGVncmF0aW9uICJdLCJzdWIiOjExNTU4MywidHlwZSI6ImFjY2VzcyIsInVzZXJfaWQiOm51bGx9.uCHTZQG3dPMkoL_kHQursly20DdpHnmDZh3RuiAU43Y\n\ncurl -k -X GET                                                 \\\n    --header 'Content-Type: application\/x-www-form-urlencoded' \\\n    --header 'Accept: application\/json'                        \\\n    --header \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\"                    \\\n    https:\/\/api.sandbox1.lenderx-labs.com\/api\/me\n\n```\n\n# LenderX Postback Events\n\nAn Outbound Transport from LenderX can be configured to POST event data to a specified URL when certain actions occur. There are two options available to have an Outbound Transport enabled for the Vendor. You can contact your LenderX Implementation Representative to have an Outbound Transport enabled on your behalf, or you can configure your own Outbound Transport through the **\/event** endpoint. \n\n## Available Events for Vendors\n\n**Event.Appraisal.Order.Accepted** | An appraisal order's renegotiated acceptance terms have been accepted\n\nThis event will trigger when an appraisal order's renegotiated acceptance terms have been accepted by the Lender.

The test is only available on a sandbox or non-production environment. \n\n# Getting Started\n\n## How do I acquire initial integration keys?\n\nAn Implementation representative will set up your Vendor account in the LexderX platform. This will include creating a \"Vendor API” key and secret, which will be provided to you via email. \n\n## How do I authenticate?\n\nReview the Authentication section of the API documentation for steps to authenticate. You will need to choose whether you will manually acquire an authentication token following the steps in that section, or you can use an OAuth2 client library to authenticate.\n\nOnce you have authenticated, you can validate your authenticate by performing a GET to the **\/me** endpoint. Valid authentications will return a 200 OK response. Invalid authentications will return a 401 Unauthorized response. \n\n## How do I set up my Vendor to receive new orders?\n\nIn order to receive new orders, the Vendor must have the required postback event **An appraisal order has been assigned to an appraiser** enabled.
