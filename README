quickstart:

in the project dir (where this readme is)

  cpanm --installdeps ./

set up api key and secret. either use env vars LENDERX_API_KEY and
LENDERX_API_SECRET or set values in the config file ./lender_xdemo.yml

run locally (adjust listen address and port as desired):
  hypnotoad -f bin/lender_xdemo -l http://*:8080

now listening on :8080

having a public https url that fowards to the postback endpoint (/postback) is
left up to the reader. whatever the public url is should be substituted for
<url> below.

commands are used as a quick interface to the api:

  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions list
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions add -u <url> -e Event.Appraisal.Order.Assigned
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions remove -i <event_id>
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions --help # for usage info

  ./bin/lender_xdemo test_order
