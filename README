quickstart:

this is a pretty standard full mojolicious app

in the project dir (where this readme is)

  cpanm --installdeps ./

set up api key and secret. either use env vars LENDERX_API_KEY and
LENDERX_API_SECRET or set values in the config file ./lender_xdemo.yml

NOTE: integration tests are dependent on having credentials set up and internet
connectivity. see notes in the tests. not thrilled with them, just wanted to
have *some* functional tests.

  prove -l t

run the api locally (adjust listen address and port as desired):
  morbo -l http://*:8080 bin/lender_xdemo

having a public https url that fowards to the postback endpoint
(/api/v1/postback) is left up to the reader. whatever the public url is should
be substituted for <url> below.

hit the api locally with any old http client (curl, whathaveyou), or commands
are available as a quick interface:

  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions list
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions add -u <url> -e Event.Appraisal.Order.Assigned
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions remove -i <event_id>
  ./bin/lender_xdemo subscriptions --help # for usage info

  ./bin/lender_xdemo test_order
